====== Agile methodology ======

Agile is a time boxed, iterative approach to software delivery that builds software
incrementally from the start of the project, instead of trying to deliver it all at once near the end.

Why do we use Agile?
    -Agile empowers people;
    -builds accountability,
    -encourages diversity of ideas, 
    -allows the early release of benefits, and promotes continuous improvement. 
    -It allows decisions to be tested and rejected early with feedback
     loops providing benefits that are not as evident in waterfall.

=========Scrum Method ==========
Scrum is a framework that helps teams work together. Much like a rugby team (where it gets its name) 
training for the big game, scrum encourages teams to learn through experiences, self-organize 
while working on a problem, and reflect on their wins and losses to continuously improve.

When to use scrum:
When requirements are not clearly defined. 
When the probability of changes during the development is high. 
When there is a need to test the solution. 
When the Product Owner (PO) is fully available. 
When the team has self-management skills.
